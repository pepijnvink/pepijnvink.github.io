    "text": "Work\nAs a student assistant I am currently involved in two main projects:\n\nI am a contributor for the ggmice package for missing data visualization in R using ggplot. This involves resolving minor bugs as well as adding new minor features, some of which have been featured in the latest release. More information on ggmice package can be found here.\nI assist the Open Science Programme at Utrecht University in the analysis of the biennial Open Science Monitor, which aims to assess attutudes and behaviors on open science practices among both scientific staff and support staff. The first results can be found here\n\n\n\nEducation\n\nMy thesis is on the use of causal inference methods to capture time-invariant confounders in cross-lagged panel models, with a focus on the RI-CLPM and the DPM. As a preliminary exploration, I wrote a research report evaluating the effect of unmeasured confounding in panel models. I write my thesis under the supervision of Ellen Hamaker and Jeroen Mulder.\nI am currently working on a research traineeship on bayesian methods for structure learning of Directed Acyclic Graphs, under the supervision of Noémi Schuurman (Utrecht University) and Maarten Marsman (University of Amsterdam). For this, I explore the literature for different methods, focusing on the difference in questions that each method may aim to answer."
